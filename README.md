To run this algorithm, simply open up a code editor (such as VSCode, or any other platform supporting Python), and open the files SeatPricer.py & TestSeatPricer.py within the editor. 
Within TestSeatPricer, there is already a test case scenario set up -- evaluating 5 seats based on the input of a theater with 10 rows, 12 columns, and a base price of $10.00.
To run, simply open your terminal and type python TestSeatPricer.py.       **(or python3* depending on which version you have installed)**

The output for the test cases should print. If you woul like to try different values for the input you may change the inputs directly within the test file, however the tests will say "failed" because the numbers will not match what is expected. You will be able to see the computed values for the new input regardless, so do so if it interests you.

Enjoy!
